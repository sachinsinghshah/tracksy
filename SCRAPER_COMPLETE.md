## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. **Start Development Server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. **Test Automatic Scraping**

1. Login to your dashboard
2. Add a new Amazon product URL:
   ```
   https://www.amazon.in/dp/B0BDK62PDX
   ```
3. Click "Track This Product"
4. **Wait 5-10 seconds** (scraping happens in background)
5. Go to "View All Products"
6. **Refresh the page** - you should now see:
   - ✅ Product title
   - ✅ Current price
   - ✅ Product image

### 3. **Test Manual Refresh**

1. Go to `/dashboard/products`
2. Find a product card
3. Click "Refresh Price" button
4. Watch the spinner
5. See toast notification with new price
6. Product card updates with latest data

### 4. **Check Price History**

Check your Supabase database:

```sql
SELECT * FROM price_history ORDER BY checked_at DESC;
```

You should see price entries!

### 5. **Test Price Drop Detection**

1. Add a product with a target price (e.g., 999)
2. If current price is lower, check `alerts` table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM alerts;
```

## 📊 What Gets Scraped

For each product, the scraper extracts:

| Data Point        | Status | Notes                          |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------------------------------ |
| **Title**         | ✅     | Full product title             |
| **Price**         | ✅     | Current price (numeric)        |
| **Image**         | ✅     | High-quality product image URL |
| **Currency**      | ✅     | Auto-detected (INR, USD, etc.) |
| **Availability**  | ✅     | In stock or not                |
| **Price History** | ✅     | Stored in database             |

## 🔍 How It Works

### Flow When Adding Product

```
1. User pastes Amazon URL
   ↓
2. POST /api/products validates and stores product
   ↓
3. Triggers POST /api/scrape in background
   ↓
4. Puppeteer launches browser
   ↓
5. Navigates to Amazon product page
   ↓
6. Extracts title, price, image
   ↓
7. Updates database with real data
   ↓
8. Stores price in price_history
   ↓
9. Checks if price < target_price
   ↓
10. Creates alert if price dropped
    ↓
11. User sees product with real data!
```

### Flow for Manual Refresh

```
1. User clicks "Refresh Price"
   ↓
2. Button shows spinner
   ↓
3. POST /api/scrape called
   ↓
4. Scraper fetches latest data
   ↓
5. Database updated
   ↓
6. Toast notification shown
   ↓
7. Page refreshes automatically
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Amazon Rate Limiting

- **Be careful!** Amazon may block if too many requests
- Currently: No rate limiting implemented
- **Recommendation**: Don't refresh too frequently
- **Future**: Implement rate limiting (3 requests/minute)

### Scraping Time

- Takes **5-10 seconds** per product
- Happens in background
- Don't expect instant results
- Refresh products page to see updates

### Headless Browser

- Puppeteer downloads Chromium (~170MB) on first install
- Runs headless in production
- May be slow on first scrape (browser launch)
- Subsequent scrapes faster

### Error Scenarios

- **Amazon blocks**: Will retry 3 times
- **Page layout changes**: May need selector updates
- **Network timeout**: 30-second timeout per request
- **Product not found**: Returns error message

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Product Not Showing Data?

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Look at terminal logs (look for `[Scraper]` and `[API]`)
3. Verify product URL is valid
4. Wait 10-15 seconds and refresh

### "Failed to scrape" Error?

- Amazon may have blocked the request
- Try again in a few minutes
- Check if URL is correct product page
- Look at terminal for detailed error

### Scrape Taking Too Long?

- First scrape downloads Chromium (one-time)
- Subsequent scrapes faster
- Amazon pages can be slow
- 5-15 seconds is normal

### Refresh Button Not Working?

- Check browser console
- Verify you're logged in
- Check network tab in DevTools
- Look for API errors
